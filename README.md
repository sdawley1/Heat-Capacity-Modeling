AS.030.421 Homework #6: Generalized Automated Curve Fitting

The importance of curve-ftting for nonlinear models cannot be understated. There are many different tools and techniques for automated curve-fitting, however, without a foundational understanding of the physical limitations of a system the reliability of a model is useless.

In this assigment we considerd two models for the heat capacity, the Debye model and the Einstein model, the first of which does a better job at modeling acoustic lattice vibrations (phonons) while the latter more closely models optical phonons. Hence, it is common to fit heat capacity data to a linear combination of a number of these two models. 

Aside from fitting data, however, when plotting either of these models we find that they limit to the same values as the temperature approaches absolute zero and as the temperature tends to infinity. At absolute zero, the heat capacity goes to zero. In the limit as the temperature goes to infinity, the molar heat capacity of a particular substance approaches 3R, where R is the ideal gas constant. This asymptotic behavior is known as the Dulong-Petit law, originally formulated in the early 19th century. 

It is important to note the importance of being able to accurately model the heat capacity of an object: The heat capacity is a measure of the amount of heat required to bring about a unit change in temperature of some compound. It has immense applications in thermodynamics and it's been said that if there was matter so rare in the universe that we could only perform one measurement on it, we should measure its heat capacity.
